## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-30

The base: the pipeline from Rust to the speakers, and the plan from one mono voice to a true algo synth (plan.md MVP 1).

### Added

- `crates/dsp`: the engine as a `wasm32-unknown-unknown` cdylib with a plain C ABI and no imports (ADR-0001). One engine per wasm instance, planar stereo 128-frame blocks, a 16-voice test voice (table sine, AR envelope) with oldest-voice stealing, master gain.
- Parameter and source registries (`Param`, `Source`: Mono, Wave, Drums) mirrored in `web/src/audio/params.ts`, the mirror checked by `cargo test` (ADR-0004).
- Real-time rules as lints: no `unwrap`, `expect`, `panic` or indexing; `unsafe` only in `ffi.rs` (ADR-0002).
- `web/`: Vue 3 + TypeScript view with transport (power, master, scope), algo pane, instruments pane (keyboards, drum pads, computer keyboard) and bar arrangement, over a static demo song (ADR-0003, ADR-0005).
- `web/public/worklet.js`: the AudioWorklet shim.
- Podman + Caddy image serving static files on port 6340; Vite dev on 6341 (ADR-0006).
- Grouped `make help`, `make check`, CI with actions pinned by commit, `cargo deny`.
- `.openspec/`: vision, plan (five milestones, eleven MVPs, the Vivaldi ensemble as second base), ADRs 0001-0006, specs 001-003.
